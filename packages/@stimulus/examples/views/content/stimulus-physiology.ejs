<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology">physiology</a>, a <strong>stimulus</strong> (plural <strong>stimuli</strong>) is a detectable change in the internal or external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(systems)">environment</a>. The ability of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism">organism</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)">organ</a> to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity. When a stimulus is applied to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_receptor">sensory receptor</a>, it normally elicits or influences a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_action">reflex</a> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(physiology)">stimulus transduction</a>. These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptors">chemoreceptors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptors">mechanoreceptors</a>. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostatic control system</a>. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response">fight-or-flight response</a>. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level must exceed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold">absolute threshold</a>; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system">central nervous system</a> (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.</p>
