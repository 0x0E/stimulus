<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology">experimental psychology</a>, a stimulus is the event or object to which a response is measured. Thus, not everything that is presented to participants qualifies as stimulus. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_mark">cross mark</a> at the center of a screen is not said to be a stimulus, because it merely serves to center participants' gaze on the screen. Also, it is uncommon to refer to longer events (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trier_social_stress_test">Trier social stress test</a>) as a stimulus, even if a response to such an event is measured.</p>
